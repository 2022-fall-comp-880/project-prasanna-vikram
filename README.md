* So I am using dataset `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores` this dataset has separate columns and we use some dictionaries and files like CSV ,OS ,Unit test files to get the output .

* modules *
# CSV FILE :
*  csv (common separated values ) file is a text file in which information is separated by commas.
* you can use a csv file to move data between programs that aren't ordinarily able to exchange data .
 
# OS FILE : 
* The OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc. You first need to import the os module to interact with the underlying operating system.
* Files are used for all input and output (I/O) of information in the operating system, to standardize access to both software and hardware.

# unit test 
* A unit test is a test that checks a single component of code, usually modularized as a function, and ensures that it performs as expected. Unit tests are an important part of regression testing to ensure that the code still functions as expected after making changes to the code and helps ensure code stability.
* it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.
